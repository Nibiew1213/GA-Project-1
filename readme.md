# Light Cycle Battle

## Technologies used:

![alt-text](./resources/html-css-js.png)

HTML, CSS and JavaScript with canvas were used to build the game. The canvas size or the play area of the game was first determined by indicating its width and height in the HTML canvas tag, thereafter, setting the number of grids and grid size in the Javascript.

## Game Concept:
This game concept is inspired by and based on a combination of 2 games: Snake + Game of GO, with the theme from the 1982 American science fiction action-adventure film: Tron. 

In the classic snake game, a single player maneuvers a growing line that becomes a primary obstacle to itself, whereas "GO" is an abstract strategy board game for two players in which the aim is to surround more territory than the opponent.

The Light Cycle Battle game will be a two player game whereby each player's objective is to remain alive within the game arena as long as possible. 

Winning the game is determined by 
+ forcing / guiding your opponent to hit the arena borders 
+ forcing / guiding your opponent to hit either player's trail
+ surrounding and trapping your opponent 

## Approach taken:
My approach in developing this game is to firstly determine and meet the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) requirements set for this project. Further improvements to the game will only be worked on after achieving a proper working game with its bugs / issues solved.   

## Method to run the game: 
The game can be played in browser here or by opening up `index.html` in the IDE of your choice.

## How to play:
+ Player 1 controls using 'WASD' keys
+ Player 2 controls using 'Arrow' keys
+ Click on 'Start' button to start the game
+ Screen size adjustment via zooming may be required

## Takeaways:
Upon completion of this project, I have learned the following key takeaways:
+ different methods of creating canvas
+ setting up collision detection
+ DOM manipulation
+ keypress logic implementation
+ code linting using Prettier

## Future improvements:
Given more time, I wish to implement the following features to my game:
+ Scoreboard / Player Lives
+ Create AI for single player
+ Sprite Animations
+ Sound effects and music
